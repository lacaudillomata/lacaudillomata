In this talk, we develop two multiscale methods to compute such type of responses in a numerically effective manner.\nGeophysical electromagnetic simulations of highly heterogeneous media are computationally expensive. One major reason for this is the fact that very fine meshes are often required to accurately discretize the physical properties of the media, which may vary over a wide range of spatial scales and several orders of magnitude. Using such fine meshes for the discrete models leads to solve large systems of equations that are often difficult to deal with. To reduce the computational cost of the electromagnetic simulation, we develop multiscale methods for the quasi-static Maxwells equations in the frequency domain.\nOur methods begin by locally computing multiscale basis functions, which incorporate the small-scale information contained in the physical properties of the media. Using a Galerkin proper orthogonal decomposition approach, the local basis functions are then used to represent the solution on a coarse mesh. Our approach leads to a significant reduction in the size of the final system of equations to be solved and in the amount of computational time of the simulation, while accurately approximating the behavior of the fine-mesh solutions. We demonstrate the performance of our methods in the context of an application in mining exploration.\nThis work is done in collaboration with Prof. Eldad Haber (UBC), Dr. Wenke Wilhelms (UBC), and Dr. Christoph Schwarzbach (Computational Geosciences).\n","date":1549584000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549584000,"objectID":"32603590ff783e28088a73281cbea27a","permalink":"https://lacaudillomata.github.io/talks/2019-02/","publishdate":"2020-08-01T22:49:58-07:00","relpermalink":"/talks/2019-02/","section":"talks","summary":"Efficient and accurate simulation of electromagnetic responses of geologically-rich geophysical settings is crucial in a variety of scenarios, including mineral and petroleum exploration, water resource utilizations, and geothermal power extractions.

Actualmente, algunos de los usos comerciales m√°s dominantes de este tipo de m√©todos se encuentran en la exploraci√≥n y el monitoreo de dep√≥sitos minerales, dep√≥sitos de agua y reservas de hidrocarburos.\nLos m√©todos EM infieren estructuras subterr√°neas a partir de mediciones de campos electromagn√©ticos. Las mediciones, o datos electromagn√©ticos, se adquieren a trav√©s de una gran variedad de sondeos geof√≠sicos que t√≠picamente se realizan en la tierra, en el mar o en pozos. Un componente importante en el procesamiento de dichos datos se realiza con t√©cnicas de simulaci√≥n electromagn√©tica directa e indirecta, las cuales resultan en modelos detallados de propiedades f√≠sicas de inter√©s de las estructuras subterr√°neas. Por ejemplo, si el objetivo del sondeo es detectar minerales, el resultado de dichas t√©cnicas num√©ricas puede ser un modelo de la distribuci√≥n de la conductividad el√©ctrica (propiedad f√≠sica para caracterizar minerales) del subsuelo. La subsecuente interpretaci√≥n geol√≥gica y la evaluaci√≥n de estos modelos de conductividad permiten comprender la distribuci√≥n espacial de las estructuras subterr√°neas y, en √∫ltima instancia, conducen a tomar mejores decisiones durante el proceso exploraci√≥n.\nLa simulaci√≥n directa e indirecta de datos EM son poderosas herramientas de interpretaci√≥n; sin embargo, al usarlas dentro de programas de exploraci√≥n industrial resultan en problemas de costo computacional excesivo. Aunque el campo de la computaci√≥n electromagn√©tica ha avanzado bastante, la simulaci√≥n directa e indirecta de datos EM para escenarios geof√≠sicos realistas siguen siendo un gran desaf√≠o computacional, cuyo principal cuello de botella es la simulaci√≥n directa de campos EM.\nLos escenarios geof√≠sicos realistas a menudo consideran grandes dominios computacionales, as√≠ como geometr√≠as con variaci√≥n geol√≥gica, topogr√°fica y otras caracter√≠sticas relacionadas con la simulaci√≥n que var√≠an en m√∫ltiples escalas espaciales (mm a km) y medios altamente heterog√©neos. Estos dos factores influyen significativamente en el comportamiento de los campos EM resultantes y deben ser adecuadamente considerados durante el proceso de mallado para que la simulaci√≥n nos de un resultado preciso. En particular, la malla usada en t√©cnicas de discretizaci√≥n tradicionales, tales como elemento finito o volumen finito, se refina lo suficiente tal que capture la estructura de la heterogeneidad del modelo detalladamente. Esto conlleva al uso de mallas grand√≠simas y el problema se traduce a resolver sistemas de ecuaciones lineales grand√≠simos (del orden de millones o billones de ecuaciones).\nUna alternativa para simular eficientemente los campos electromagn√©ticos en estos casos es usar m√©todos multiscala. Estos m√©todos forman parte de la familia de m√©todos de reducci√≥n de dimensionalidad, los cuales aspiran a reducir el tama√±o del sistema de ecuaciones lineales que ser√° finalmente resuelto.

Sophisticated tools from statistics, numerical optimization, numerical linear algebra, and multiscale analysis are required to address these challenges.\nThe goal of this special session is to gather a diverse and accomplished pool of experts working in the active and thriving research area of computational inverse problems who will present an overview of the state of-the-art methods to address the key challenges discussed.

In this talk, we present a new Multiscale finite volume method that computes these electromagnetic responses in a very effective manner.\nGeophysical time-varying electromagnetic simulations of highly heterogeneous media are computationally expensive. One reason for this is the fact that very fine meshes are often required to accurately discretize the physical properties of the media, which may vary over a wide range of length scales and several orders of magnitude. Using very fine meshes for the discrete models lead to solve large systems of equations that are often difficult to deal with at each time step.\nTo reduce the computational cost of the electromagnetic simulation, we develop a Multiscale finite volume method for the quasistatic Maxwell‚Äôs equations in the time domain. Our method begins by locally computing Multiscale basis functions at each time step, which incorporate the small-scale information contained in the physical properties of the media. Using a Galerkin proper orthogonal decomposition approach, the local basis functions are used to represent the solution on a coarse mesh. The governing equations are numerically integrated using an implicit time marching scheme.\nOur approach leads to a significant reduction in the size of the final system of equations to be solved and in the amount of computational time of the simulation, while accurately approximating the behavior of the fine-mesh solutions. We demonstrate the performance of our method in the context of an airborne geophysical application.\n","date":1458777600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1458777600,"objectID":"7aeb0ff794ce0a2d18ac70f953229369","permalink":"https://lacaudillomata.github.io/talks/2016-03/","publishdate":"2020-08-01T21:53:08-07:00","relpermalink":"/talks/2016-03/","section":"talks","summary":"Efficient and accurate simulation of transient electromagnetic fields and fluxes of complex geological settings is crucial in a variety of scenarios, including mineral and petroleum exploration, water resource utilizations and geothermal power extractions.","tags":[],"title":"Upscaling and Multiscale Finite Volume Methods for Geophysical Electromagnetic Modeling","type":"talks"},{"authors":["Luz Angelica Caudillo Mata","Eldad Haber"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1435622400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1435622400,"objectID":"ebe54a3375ce8fca9659c7590c5eee9a","permalink":"https://lacaudillomata.github.io/talks/2015-07/","publishdate":"2020-08-01T21:29:06-07:00","relpermalink":"/talks/2015-07/","section":"talks","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Upscale and Multiscale Methods in Electromagnetics","type":"talks"},{"authors":["Luz Angelica Caudillo Mata","Eldad Haber","Lars Ruthotto","Christoph Schwarzbach"],"categories":null,"content":"In Geophysics, simulation of low-frequency Electromagnetic (EM) fields in highly heterogeneous, anisotropic media is computationally very expensive.
