In this talk, we develop two multiscale methods to compute such type of responses in a numerically effective manner.\nGeophysical electromagnetic simulations of highly heterogeneous media are computationally expensive. One major reason for this is the fact that very fine meshes are often required to accurately discretize the physical properties of the media, which may vary over a wide range of spatial scales and several orders of magnitude. Using such fine meshes for the discrete models leads to solve large systems of equations that are often difficult to deal with. To reduce the computational cost of the electromagnetic simulation, we develop multiscale methods for the quasi-static Maxwells equations in the frequency domain.\nOur methods begin by locally computing multiscale basis functions, which incorporate the small-scale information contained in the physical properties of the media. Using a Galerkin proper orthogonal decomposition approach, the local basis functions are then used to represent the solution on a coarse mesh.

Actualmente, algunos de los usos comerciales más dominantes de este tipo de métodos se encuentran en la exploración y el monitoreo de depósitos minerales, depósitos de agua y reservas de hidrocarburos.\nLos métodos EM infieren estructuras subterráneas a partir de mediciones de campos electromagnéticos. Las mediciones, o datos electromagnéticos, se adquieren a través de una gran variedad de sondeos geofísicos que típicamente se realizan en la tierra, en el mar o en pozos. Un componente importante en el procesamiento de dichos datos se realiza con técnicas de simulación electromagnética directa e indirecta, las cuales resultan en modelos detallados de propiedades físicas de interés de las estructuras subterráneas. Por ejemplo, si el objetivo del sondeo es detectar minerales, el resultado de dichas técnicas numéricas puede ser un modelo de la distribución de la conductividad eléctrica (propiedad física para caracterizar minerales) del subsuelo. La subsecuente interpretación geológica y la evaluación de estos modelos de conductividad permiten comprender la distribución espacial de las estructuras subterráneas y, en última instancia, conducen a tomar mejores decisiones durante el proceso exploración.\nLa simulación directa e indirecta de datos EM son poderosas herramientas de interpretación; sin embargo, al usarlas dentro de programas de exploración industrial resultan en problemas de costo computacional excesivo. Aunque el campo de la computación electromagnética ha avanzado bastante, la simulación directa e indirecta de datos EM para escenarios geofísicos realistas siguen siendo un gran desafío computacional, cuyo principal cuello de botella es la simulación directa de campos EM.\nLos escenarios geofísicos realistas a menudo consideran grandes dominios computacionales, así como geometrías con variación geológica, topográfica y otras características relacionadas con la simulación que varían en múltiples escalas espaciales (mm a km) y medios altamente heterogéneos. Estos dos factores influyen significativamente en el comportamiento de los campos EM resultantes y deben ser adecuadamente considerados durante el proceso de mallado para que la simulación nos de un resultado preciso. En particular, la malla usada en técnicas de discretización tradicionales, tales como elemento finito o volumen finito, se refina lo suficiente tal que capture la estructura de la heterogeneidad del modelo detalladamente.

For example, in many physical systems, measurements are obtained on the exterior of an object (e.g., the human body or the earth’s crust), and they are used with the goal of estimating the internal structure(s) or physical properties of such object.\nCurrently, the main challenges in the field of inverse problems are (1) the affordable computation of the forward model, especially for models with multiple length-scale features, (2) the efficient and reliable computation of solutions to inverse problems, and (3) the development of statistical methods to validate model assumptions and inversion estimates. Sophisticated tools from statistics, numerical optimization, numerical linear algebra, and multiscale analysis are required to address these challenges.\nThe goal of this special session is to gather a diverse and accomplished pool of experts working in the active and thriving research area of computational inverse problems who will present an overview of the state of-the-art methods to address the key challenges discussed. For example, speakers will present on new nonlinear optimization approaches, novel regularization techniques, iterative reconstruction techniques (e.g., hybrid methods and preconditioners), methods for statistical validation and uncertainty quantification, and the progress on multiscale methods and their applications within an inversion procedure.\n","date":1500940800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1500940800,"objectID":"41b6ce00a91c2d0ed1b22cbf7ce7cb1c","permalink":"https://lacaudillomata.github.io/community/2017-congress-americas/","publishdate":"2017-07-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/community/2017-congress-americas/","section":"community","summary":"Special session (minysimposium) held as part of the Mathematical Congress of the Americas 2017.","tags":["Series"],"title":"Computational Inverse Problems: from Multiscale Modeling to Uncertainty Quantification","type":"community"},{"authors":["Luz Angelica Caudillo Mata","Eldad Haber","Christoph Schwarzbach"],"categories":null,"content":"Accurate and efficient simulation of electromagnetic (EM) responses in large-scale settings with highly heterogeneous media and features varying at multiple spatial scales is crucial to the exploration and imaging of geological formations in a wide range of geophysical applications.

This cost comes from solving a giant system of equations that results from the discretization of this type of large-scale settings, which often require very detailed meshes. Multiscale and Upscaling finite volume (FV) and finite element (FE) techniques have been extensively studied in the field of modeling flow in heterogeneous porous media, where they have been successfully used to drastically reduce the size of the linear system while producing accurate solutions similar to that obtained with FE or FV discretization schemes on a fine mesh.

In this talk, we present a new Multiscale finite volume method that computes these electromagnetic responses in a very effective manner.\nGeophysical time-varying electromagnetic simulations of highly heterogeneous media are computationally expensive. One reason for this is the fact that very fine meshes are often required to accurately discretize the physical properties of the media, which may vary over a wide range of length scales and several orders of magnitude. Using very fine meshes for the discrete models lead to solve large systems of equations that are often difficult to deal with at each time step.\nTo reduce the computational cost of the electromagnetic simulation, we develop a Multiscale finite volume method for the quasistatic Maxwell’s equations in the time domain. Our method begins by locally computing Multiscale basis functions at each time step, which incorporate the small-scale information contained in the physical properties of the media. Using a Galerkin proper orthogonal decomposition approach, the local basis functions are used to represent the solution on a coarse mesh. The governing equations are numerically integrated using an implicit time marching scheme.\nOur approach leads to a significant reduction in the size of the final system of equations to be solved and in the amount of computational time of the simulation, while accurately approximating the behavior of the fine-mesh solutions.

[1]\nIn recent years, electromagnetic modelling and inversion techniques based on finite volume and finite elements have been studied extensively due to their usefulness in theory as well as in practice [2]. Although the theoretical foundation for these methods is straight-forward, it can face major difficulties when used to simulate realistic situations.\nOne of the fundamental issues is modelling the vast heterogeneity of geological targets in terms of scale, magnitude and anisotropy. Robust and accurate simulations require very fine meshes, especially when the earth is highly heterogeneous. Such meshes are difficult-to-work-with and may lead to very expensive-to-compute simulations when considering large earth-multiscale scenarios. For instance, geological characterizations typically contain on the order of 1e7 to 1e8 cells. These models, which are referred as fine models, represent geological variations on very fine scales vertically, though their areal resolution is still relatively coarse [3].\nNumerical upscaling is a mathematical procedure that strive to develop coarse scale models to accurately approximate fine scale ones. Therefore, it is a useful resource to alleviate the computational cost. Upscaling of Maxwell’s equations presents big challenges such as choosing the appropriate upscaling method and the assessment of risk and uncertainty in geological characterizations.\nIn this work, we present insights on how to build an efficient framework that allows for homogenization and upscaling of the Maxwell’s Equations’ coefficients trying to address the challenges mentioned above. One example on geological characterization is provided.\nReferences [1] D. Oldenburg and D.

The proposed approach has the advantage that the proposed closed form formula is applicable for any source term $F(x,t)$.
