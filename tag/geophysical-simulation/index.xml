      <title>Multiscale Methods For Geophysical Electromagnetics Modeling</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The focus of this investigation is to study how to reduce the computational cost
of simulating the behavior of electromagnetic fields in complicated geophysical
settings. This type of simulations are crucial to the exploration of buried natural
resources (mineral, groundwater and hydrocarbon deposits) using electromagnetic methods. However, the size of the computation they involve often exceeds
the limits of average computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This investigation proposes innovative mathematical alternatives — multiscale finite elements and finite volume methods — that achieve a great reduction of the problem’s size and the simulation cost without sacrificing much accuracy. It also opens the door to use such alternatives to create more powerful computational engines capable of simulating electromagnetic fields in larger and more complex geophysical settings than currently
is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project was done as part of my doctoral dissertation. To provide more context, this study was the first one in the literature to demonstrate the practical use of the proposed alternatives in the context of geophysical
electromagnetic problems.&lt;/p&gt;
