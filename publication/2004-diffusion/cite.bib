abstract={In this paper a discrete eigenfunctions method for constructing numerical solutions of mixed diffusion problem with space varying properties and source term is developed. After discretization, instead of solving algebraically the discretized problem, we propose a discrete eigenfunctions method which reduces the computational cost of standard finite difference methods.;Byline: L. Jodar, L.A. Caudillo-Mata Keywords: Diffusion problem; Eigenfunctions method; Computational cost In this paper a discrete eigenfunctions method for constructing numerical solutions of mixed diffusion problem with space varying properties and source term is developed. After discretization, instead of solving algebraically the discretized problem, we propose a discrete eigenfunctions method which reduces the computational cost of standard finite difference methods.
