Electromagnetic simulations of complex geologic settings are computationally

expensive. One reason for this is the fact that a fine mesh is required to

accurately discretize the electrical conductivity model of a given setting.

This conductivity model may vary over several orders of magnitude and these

variations can occur over a large range of length scales. Using a very fine

mesh for the discretization of this setting leads to the necessity to solve a

large system of equations that is often difficult to deal with. To keep the

simulations computationally tractable, coarse meshes are often employed for the

discretization of the model. Such coarse meshes typically fail to capture the

fine-scale variations in the conductivity model resulting in inaccuracies in

the predicted data. In this work, we introduce a framework for constructing a

coarse-mesh or upscaled conductivity model based on a prescribed fine-mesh

model. Rather than using analytical expressions, we opt to pose upscaling as a

parameter estimation problem. By solving an optimization problem, we obtain a

coarse-mesh conductivity model. The optimization criterion can be tailored to

the survey setting in order to produce coarse models that accurately reproduce

the predicted data generated on the fine mesh. This allows us to upscale

arbitrary conductivity structures, as well as to better understand the meaning

of the upscaled quantity. We use 1D and 3D examples to demonstrate that the

proposed framework is able to emulate the behavior of the heterogeneity in the

fine-mesh conductivity model, and to produce an accurate description of the

desired predicted data obtained by using a coarse mesh in the simulation

process.;Byline: L.A. Caudillo-Mata, E. Haber, L.J. Heagy, C. Schwarzbach Electromagnetic simulations of complex geologic settings are computationally expensive.
